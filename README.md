# swift-reactive-viper-example

This is intended to be a working example of the "VIPER" architecture showcased in the article by objc.io and on https://github.com/mutualmobile/VIPER-SWIFT repository, but using ReactiveCocoa 3 and Swift 2.

So far it is a disaster because I am having trouble wrapping my head around whether this makes sense to do.

In particular, I'm not sure whether or where to use RAC3 - especially given the current interfaces.

Help appreciated.
